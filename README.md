**This repository is a fork from [SpikingConvNet](https://github.com/ggoupy/SpikingConvNet)**

## Installation

- Download [MNIST Dataset](https://data.deepai.org/mnist.zip) and add it to MNIST folder after having uncompressed it. You should have files like `train-labels-idx1-ubyte`

- Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
```sh
# WINDOWS
py -m pip virtualenv .env
.env/Script/activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# LINUX
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Launch `snn.py`
